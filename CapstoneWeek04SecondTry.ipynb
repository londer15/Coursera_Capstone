    "The business targets homeowners living far from downtown, at least 5Km from Boston's central area, that may suffer with heavy traffic and travel long distances just to bring their devices/appliances to be fixed in downtown; these situations expose customers to risks considered to be relatively high, such as, armed robbery, damage during transport, etc. The company will offer affordable and fast repairs in-home in order to attract new customers and stay competitive. Additionally, the service catalog encompasses: computers, smartphone and table, and home appliances repairs."
